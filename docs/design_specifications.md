# Cosmic Pi Design Specifications

## Introduction
This document outlines the design specifications for the Cosmic Pi project, detailing the user interface, system components, and interaction flows.

## User Interface Design
### Dashboard
- **Overview:** The main dashboard provides users with a summary of their account, recent transactions, and available resources.
- **Components:**
  - Navigation Bar: Links to Home, Transactions, Resources, and Settings.
  - Summary Cards: Display total balance, recent transactions, and resource status.

### Transaction Page
- **Overview:** A dedicated page for managing transactions.
- **Components:**
  - Input Fields: For entering recipient address and amount.
  - Submit Button: To initiate the transaction.
  - Transaction History: A list of past transactions with status indicators.

## System Component Design
### Blockchain Layer
- **Technology Stack:** Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL.
- **Key Features:**
  - Smart Contracts: Written in Solidity for automated transactions.
  - Consensus Mechanism: Hybrid PoS and DPoS for enhanced security.

### API Layer
- **Architecture:** RESTful API with JSON responses.
- **Endpoints:** User management, transaction processing, and resource handling.

## Interaction Flows
### User Registration Flow
1. User fills out the registration form.
2. System validates input and creates a new user account.
3. Confirmation email is sent to the user.

### Transaction Flow
1. User initiates a transaction.
2. System verifies user balance and processes the transaction.
3. Transaction status is updated and reflected in the user's dashboard.

## Conclusion
The design specifications provide a comprehensive overview of the Cosmic Pi projectâ€™s architecture and user interface. This document will be updated as the project evolves and new features are added.
