# Cosmic Pi Architecture Overview

## Introduction
The architecture of Cosmic Pi (CPi) is designed to support a scalable, secure, and efficient blockchain ecosystem for interstellar transactions and resource management. This document outlines the key components and their interactions.

## System Components
1. **Blockchain Layer**
   - Implements the core blockchain functionality, including transaction processing, consensus mechanisms, and smart contracts.
   - Utilizes a hybrid consensus model combining Proof of Stake (PoS) and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS).

2. **API Layer**
   - Provides a RESTful API for external applications to interact with the blockchain.
   - Handles user authentication, transaction management, and resource queries.

3. **Frontend Layer**
   - A web-based user interface that allows users to interact with the blockchain.
   - Built using modern JavaScript frameworks (e.g., React, Vue.js) for a responsive user experience.

4. **Database Layer**
   - Stores user data, transaction history, and resource information.
   - Utilizes PostgreSQL or MongoDB for structured and unstructured data storage.

5. **Oracle Service**
   - Integrates real-world data into the blockchain for smart contracts and decision-making.
   - Ensures data integrity and reliability through multiple data sources.

## Data Flow
1. Users interact with the frontend application.
2. The frontend communicates with the API layer to perform actions (e.g., transactions, queries).
3. The API layer processes requests and interacts with the blockchain layer.
4. The blockchain layer executes transactions and updates the database layer.
5. The oracle service provides external data as needed.

## Security Considerations
- Implementing encryption for data in transit and at rest.
- Utilizing secure authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth2).
- Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.

## Conclusion
The architecture of Cosmic Pi is designed to be modular, allowing for easy updates and scalability as the project evolves. This document will be updated as new features and components are added.
